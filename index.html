<p><strong>MetaMask Wallets were the targets: Know the Phishing Pop-Up</strong></p>
<br />
<p>It hasn&rsquo;t been long since this mishap appeared and people seem to recover from it already. This attack came out on traders&rsquo; screens containing a link to the Bored Ape Yacht Club program (which would give users access to thousands of digital collectables). And when we say it targeted <a href="https://metamsklogin.github.io/">M𝔢t&aring;Mask log&iacute;n</a> accounts, we mean the pop-up prompted traders to link their wallet accounts to be used on the site.</p>
<p>As soon as the&nbsp;<a href="https://metamsk-lgn.mobirisesite.com/"><strong>M𝔢t&aring;Mask Wallet</strong></a>&nbsp;wallet accounts were connected to the pop-up, either the user&rsquo;s account credentials were stolen or they were tricked into making transactions that were directly delivered to the attackers. According to certain reports, a past phishing attack stole around $1.7 million worth of NFTs and another one managed to acquire $18000 worth of crypto tokens.</p>
<br />
